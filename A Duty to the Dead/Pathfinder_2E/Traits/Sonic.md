# Sonic
#pf2e/trait 
*Source* Core Rulebook pg. 636 

An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum.

This is different from an [Auditory](Auditory.md) spell, which is effective only if the target can hear it. A sonic effect might deal sonic damage. A creature with this trait has a magical connection to powerful sound.
