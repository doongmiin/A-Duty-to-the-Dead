The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md). Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with a believable fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead body. If the target's death seems absurd—for instance, a barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage—the GM can grant the attacker an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the illusion. If the target uses [Hostile Actions](../../../Rules/Hostile%20Actions.md), the spell ends. This ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse disappears too.

**Heightened (7th)** The spell doesn't end if the target uses hostile actions.
