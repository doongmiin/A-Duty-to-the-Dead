Your voice projects like cracking thunder as you summon a localized storm, creating a fearsome surge of lightning and wind that deals `dice: 6d6|avg` electricity damage. Each creature must attempt a Reflex saving throw.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature takes half damage.  
**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is knocked [Prone](../../../Conditions/Prone.md).  
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is knocked [Prone](../../../Conditions/Prone.md), and is [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 1.

<hr>

**Heightened (7th)** The damage increases to `dice: 8d6|avg`, and targets who critically fail are [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 2.  
**Heightened (9th)** The damage increases to `dice: 10d6|avg`, and targets who critically fail are [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 3.
