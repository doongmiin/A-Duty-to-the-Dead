You enhance the target's senses. The target gains [Low-Light Vision](../../../Bestiary/Abilities/Low-Light%20Vision.md), and all of the target's imprecise senses have their distances doubled. If the target already has low-light vision, they gain [darkvision](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Bestiary/Abilities/Darkvision).

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The number of targets increases by 1.
