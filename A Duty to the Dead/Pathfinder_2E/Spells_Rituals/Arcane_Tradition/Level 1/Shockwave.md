You create a wave of energy that ripples through the earth. Terrestrial creatures in the affected area must attempt a Reflex save to avoid stumbling as the shockwave shakes the ground.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Success** The creature is [Flat-footed](../../../Conditions/Flat-footed.md) until the start of its next turn.  
**Failure** The creature falls [Prone](../../../Conditions/Prone.md).  
**Critical Failure** As failure, plus the creature takes `dice: 1d6|avg` damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The area increases by 5 feet (to a 20-foot cone at 2nd level, and so on).
