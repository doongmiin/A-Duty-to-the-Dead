# Invisible Item

__Source__ Advanced Player's Guide pg. 221 2.0  
**Traditions** arcane, occult  
**Cast** ►► material, somatic  
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 object  
**Duration** 1 hour

You make the object [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md). This makes it [Undetected](../../../Conditions/Undetected.md) to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it [Hidden](../../../Conditions/Hidden.md) to them instead if they succeed. If the item is used as part of a [Hostile](../../../Conditions/Hostile.md) action, the spell ends after that [Hostile](../../../Conditions/Hostile.md) action is completed.

Making a weapon [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md) typically doesn't give any advantage to the attack, except that an [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md) [Thrown](../../../Traits/Thrown.md) weapon or piece of ammunition can be used for an attack without necessarily giving information about the attacker's hiding place unless the weapon returns to the attacker.
