You shroud an area in illusory dreamstuff, making the ground look and feel like a deep mire or quicksand. Ground in the area is difficult terrain.

Each creature in the area when the spell is cast, or that enters the area, must attempt a Will save. On a failure, it believes it's being [pulled](../../../Rules/Forced%20Movement.md) down by the earth, taking a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds. On a critical failure, it's also [Immobilized](../../../Conditions/Immobilized.md). In addition to the normal actions to [Escape](../../../Rules/Actions/Escape.md), at the end of an affected creature's turn, it can attempt a Will save, removing the effects on a success. On a critical success at any Will save made against oneiric mire, the creature fully [disbelieves](../../../Rules/Disbelieving%20an%20Illusion.md) the illusion and no longer needs to make Will saves to risk a Speed penalty or being [Immobilized](../../../Conditions/Immobilized.md), though the area is still difficult terrain.
