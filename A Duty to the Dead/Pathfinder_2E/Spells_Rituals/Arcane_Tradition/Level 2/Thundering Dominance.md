You shroud the target in a powerful predatory aura and amplify its vocalizations. It gains a +1 status bonus to Intimidation checks. Once during this spell's duration, it can take the Thundering Roar action.

Thundering Roar ► ([Auditory](../../../Traits/Auditory.md), [Concentrate](../../../Traits/Concentrate.md), [Emotion](../../../Traits/Emotion.md), [Enchantment](../../../Traits/Enchantment.md), [Fear](../Level%201/Fear.md), [Flourish](../../../Traits/Flourish.md), [Mental](../../../Traits/Mental.md), [Sonic](../../../Traits/Sonic.md)) The target unleashes a powerful vocalization. Each enemy in a 10foot emanation takes `dice: 4d8|avg` sonic damage with a basic Will save against your spell DC. A creature that fails its Will save is also [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 1.

<hr>

**Heightened (+2)** The status bonus to Intimidation checks increases by 1 (to a maximum of a +4 status bonus for an 8th-level spell), and the damage from the roar increases by `dice: 2d8|avg`.
