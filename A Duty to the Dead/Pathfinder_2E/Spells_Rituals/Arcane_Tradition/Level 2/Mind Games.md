You lock minds with the target, trying to mentally subdue them. The target must attempt a Will save. Each time you Sustain this Spell, the target attempts another Will save.

**Critical Success** You are [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 1 and the spell ends.  
**Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Failure** The target is [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 1.  
**Critical Failure** The target is [Stunned](../../../Conditions/Stunned.md) 2.
