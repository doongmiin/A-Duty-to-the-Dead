# Restrained

Source Core Rulebook pg. 622

You're tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You have the [Flat-footed](Flat-footed.md) and [Immobilized](Immobilized.md) conditions, and you can't use any actions with the [Attack](../Traits/Attack.md) or [Manipulate](../Traits/Manipulate.md) traits except to attempt to [Escape](../Rules/Actions/Escape.md) or [Force Open](../Rules/Actions/Force%20Open.md) your bonds. Restrained overrides [Grabbed](Grabbed.md).
