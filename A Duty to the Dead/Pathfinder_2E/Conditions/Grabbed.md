# Grabbed

**Source**: Core Rulebook pg. 620

You're held in place by another creature, giving you the [Flat-footed](Flat-footed.md) and [Immobilized](Immobilized.md) conditions. If you attempt a [References/Actions/Manipulate](References/Actions/Manipulate) action while grabbed, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or it is lost; roll the check after spending the action, but before any effects are applied.
