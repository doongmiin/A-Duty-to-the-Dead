Notes from Kylee's "A Duty to the Dead" pf2e campaign. For best results, open the "A Duty to the Dead" directory as a vault in Obisian.md

# Initial Creation
Initial creation of this repository followed the directions in Josh Plunkett's Youtube video, [Obsidian - Setting up a Pathfinder 2e Vault](https://youtu.be/-gJZe9BN9pU).

## Step-by-Step
NOTE: Steps 1-5 are just Josh Plunkett's preferences.
1. Settings > Options > Appearance > Base color scheme = Light
2. Settings > Options > Appearance > Themes > "Manage" = "ITS Theme"
3. Create a new directory = ~/.obsidian/snippets/
4. FROM GitHub SIRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme/ download "Theme - All Alternate Themes.css"
5. Save that css file to ~/./obsidian/snippets/
6. Settings > Options > Appearance > CSS snippets > "Theme - All Alternate Themes.css" = TRUE

7. Settings > Options > Community plugins > "Turn on community plugins"
8. Settings > Options > Community plugins > Community plugins > "Browse"

NOTE: Ensure Settings > Options > Core Plugins > Templates = TRUE
TIP: Designate Settings > Options > Hotkeys > "Templates: Insert template" = [Alt + T]

9. FROM GitHub ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGShare/ download ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGShare/TTRPGShare_Community_Vaults/Pathfinder_2E/
10. Copy /Pathfinder_2E/ to the Obsidian Vault.
    NOTE: In a roundabout way, Josh Plunkett copies the contents of /Pathfinder_2E/ into ~/mechanics. but I copied the folder itself; In other words, his ~/mechanics folder is my ~/Pathfinder_2E folder.
11. Open Command Palette, "Reload app without saving"

12. Move ~/Pathfinder_2E/GM Screen/ to ~/GM Screen/

13. Create directories
    - ~/Party
    - ~/World
    - ~/Z_Conversion_Tools
    - ~/zz_Attachments
    - ~/zz_Templates
